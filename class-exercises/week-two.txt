Week-Two-Exercise 
##Commands from the tutorial 
pwd 

ls -F 
 
#creating a directory

mkdir Thesis #making directory 

ls -F        #checking if directory was made 

#creating a text file 
cd Thesis #changing working directory to the one just made 

nano draft.txt #making a text file 

*typed in text file* 

*ctrl+o* + *enter* #saving what is in the text file

*ctrl+x*  #quiting editor and returns to shell 

#checking for the txt file 
 
ls # outputs file 

#creating files in a different way 

touch my_file.txt

1. The "touch" command essentially creates a new file. The file can be viewed in the GUI explorer and using the "ls" command. 
2. when using the "ls -l" command, we can see the my_file.txt has zero bytes. 
3. we can use this when we need a blank text file 

#moving files and directories 
cd Thesis #going back to Thesis directory 

mv Thesis/draft.txt Thesis/quotes.txt # moving the first text file to the second, basically renaming the file 

cd Thesis 

ls  # returned the "quotes.txt" file 

mv Thesis/quotes.txt. # moving to pwd 

ls Thesis #quotes file is no longer in here 

ls quotes.txt #brings up the file

#copying files and directories 
cp quotes.txt Thesis/quotations.txt #copying txtx file to thesis directory 
ls quotes.tct Thesis/quotations.txt #verifying the quotes file had been copied 


cp -r Thesis Thesis_backup # this is using the recursive option and it just backups to a directory
ls Thesis Thesis_backup #gives us the files in the directories 

#renaming files 
2. The command "mv" would rename the file so the answer is #2, mv statstics.txt statistics.tx 

#moving and copying
The closing of the "ls" command in each of the lines 
2. the "recombine", in which we can then see what is listed in the "recombine" folder that was created through "mkdir"

#removing files and directories 
rm quotes.txt #removing said file

ls quotes.txt #verifying said file was removed 

1. when using "rm -i Thesis_backup/quotations.txt we are making sure that is all that is being deleted and it makes sure you want to delete with a Y/N option

rm Thesis  # this command did not work because it can only work on removing files 
rm -r Thesis #deletes the directory 

#operations with multiple files and directories 
1. when using multiple file names, "cp" command it will give an error if the last arguement is not a directory

#list filenames, matching a pattern 
3. the ls command that will produce "ethane.pdb methane.pdb" is "ls *t??ne.pdb" because * matches zero or more characters and "?" matches exactly one character. 

# more on wildcards-filling in the blanks 
cp*calibration.txt backup/calibration
cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
cp*-23-datasets* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/

#organizing directories and files 
1. mv *.dat analyzed 

#Reproduce a folder structure 
1-2. the first two command boxes will create said folder structure as directories and folders must be created in order, at a time
