I piped several commands: 

1. first removing the header "tail -n +2 Pacifici2013_data.csv" 

2. then taking only the 2-6 columns "cut -d ";" -f 2-6" 

3. then changing the current delimeter with a space "tr ";" "" "

4. then sorting the file from -r for reverse order -n will sort numerically and -k will specify the column "sort -r -n -k 6"
while the "> bodym.csv" outputs the pipe commands to that csv file.
