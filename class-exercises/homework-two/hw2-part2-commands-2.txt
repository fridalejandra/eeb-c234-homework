The first thing I did was go into said dir of the file in question

1. cd ~Developer/repos/CSB/unix/data

then I did the word count -l (which gives the lines) and saved it into a text file. 

2. wc | head -n 24 Pacifici2013_data.csv | nano Pacifici-25wordcount.txt

3. then moved the file using the "mv" command to move the file to the homework-two folder
