1. \bs\S*\b

2. (\w+)\.

3. \s*[^.?]*

4. \s*[^.?]*struggle for existence[^.?]\?

Bonus Question 

(?:^|(?:[.!?]\s))(\w+)

The question mark colon combination "?:" allows us to match but not necessarily capture.So we are matching all the words "(\w+)", after the punctuation and space "(?:[.!?]\s)" and capturing just the word "w\+".
